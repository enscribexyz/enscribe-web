# **Enscribe Editorial Style Guide**

This is the **Enscribe Editorial Style Guide**, which exists to:

* Ensure a baseline level of quality and consistency across all content types  
* Align tone, clarity, and voice across all Enscribe communications  
* Help contributors—including LLMs—create clear, compelling content that resonates with our audience

## **Why Use This Style Guide?**

If you use this guide, you'll help tell Enscribe’s story with consistency and professionalism. You’ll also increase the likelihood of user trust, organic amplification, and clear onboarding for developers and web3 users.

## **About Enscribe**

Enscribe is a smart contract naming service built on the Ethereum Name Service (ENS). It allows developers assign human-readable names to smart contracts. This improves UX for Ethereum, but replacing hexadecimal smart contract addresses with ENS names, and increases security by eliminating address spoofing and poisoning attacks which hexadecimal contract addresses are susceptible to.

## **Critical Style Conventions**

* **Always refer to Enscribe as ‘Enscribe’.** Avoid all caps, alternate spellings, or references like "ENScribe".  
* **Use the word ‘onchain’** instead of ‘web3’ or ‘crypto’. It’s spelled "onchain", not "on-chain" or "on chain".  
* **Clarify technical terms** in plain language. Avoid unexplained jargon, especially in user-facing content.  
* **Use readable, active grammar.** Prioritize short, declarative sentences and avoid excessive modifiers.  
* **Describe integrations neutrally.** Say “launched on Enscribe” or “uses Enscribe” instead of “partnered with Enscribe” unless it's an official collaboration.

## **What to Avoid**

To increase the clarity and credibility of your Enscribe content:

* ❌ **Avoid financial promises:** No mention of profits, high yields, or investments.  
* ❌ **Don’t focus on tokens:** Enscribe is not a token project.  
* ❌ **Avoid vague hype:** No “the best”, “first ever”, or unverified superlatives.  
* ❌ **No aggressive formatting:** Avoid caps-lock, excessive emojis, and clickbait.  
* ❌ **No unlicensed IP:** Ensure you have rights to everything you share.  
* ❌ **Avoid disparaging competitors:** Celebrate Enscribe’s strengths without comparison.  
* ❌ **Don't mislead:** Always fact-check, link to sources, and be precise.

## **Writing Guidelines**

### **Emphasize Enscribe's Purpose**

Enscribe helps improve UX and security for working with smart contract-based applications. The mission of Enscribe is to make Ethereum the safest and most user-friendly blockchain. All communications should reinforce that utility.

### **Focus on Real Use Cases**

Avoid vague ideas like "Enscribe transforms web3." Instead, show what it does: naming contracts, improves information about contracts with its verifications, or helping users identify which contracts belong to a known protocol.

### **Celebrate Builders**

Highlight developers, security firms, protocols, and DAOs using Enscribe. Promote a builder-first mindset.

### **Be a Bridge**

Assume many readers are web3-curious or new to ENS. Use analogies and simple examples where helpful: e.g., “Enscribe names contracts like you name a website domain.”

### **When Using LLMs**

If LLMs (language models) are contributing to content creation:

* Prompt them with this style guide context.  
* Ask for factual accuracy and check citations.  
* Revise content for clarity, tone, and originality.  
* Avoid filler phrases like “In conclusion” or “It is important to note that…”

### **AI Writing & Language Hygiene**

**Avoid AI clichés and generic marketing adjectives.**

The following words and phrases are banned unless used intentionally and sparingly, backed by concrete examples:

* ❌ thrilled  
* ❌ seamless  
* ❌ powerful  
* ❌ easier than ever before  
* ❌ accessible  
* ❌ intuitive  
* ❌ revolutionary  
* ❌ game-changing  
* ❌ unlock the potential  
* ❌ next-level  
* ❌ frictionless  
* ❌ user-friendly  
* ❌ world-class  
* ❌ experience like never before

**Why?** These terms are overused by generative tools and strip writing of its specificity and trustworthiness. They feel like filler and don’t reflect the grounded, developer-first tone we’re aiming for.

## **Tone and Voice**

### **Voice (Consistent Personality)**

* Transparent and builder-focused  
* Curious and future-minded  
* Direct, clear, and human  
* Helpful, without being boastful  
* Advocating for openness and security

### **Tone (Contextual Expression)**

* Conversational, not casual  
* Plainspoken, not corporate  
* Witty when appropriate, never snarky  
* Confident, not overconfident  
* Focused on outcomes, not fluff

**Example:**

Enscribe makes smart contracts easier to trust by giving them human-readable names. Whether you’re shipping a protocol or exploring onchain interactions, a name helps you know what you’re signing.

## **Clarity, Concision, and Flow**

* **Use active voice.**  
  * ✅ “Enscribe deploys and names contracts.”  
  * ❌ “Contracts are named and deployed by Enscribe.”  
* **Avoid vague modifiers.**  
  * ✅ “Enscribe supports Sourcify verifications.”  
  * ❌ “Enscribe fully and seamlessly integrates all verifications.”  
* **Prefer plain English.**  
  * ✅ “Use” instead of “utilize”  
  * ✅ “Start” instead of “commence”  
* **Break up long sentences.** Two shorter ones are usually better.  
* **Avoid "...and more" endings.** Be specific.

## **Formatting and Nuances**

### **Capitalization**

* Use sentence case for headings and article titles.  
* Write “Enscribe” with a capital “E” and lowercase everywhere else.

### **Punctuation**

* Use the **Oxford comma**.  
* Use **em dashes** with spaces on both sides ( — ), but minimise their usage as they are associated with AI content  
* Avoid ampersands unless in a brand name.

### **Numbers and Dates**

* Spell out numbers zero through nine.  
* Use numerals 10+ (e.g., 10, 25, 100K).  
* Format dates as: “June 5, 2025”  
* Use time zones when scheduling (e.g., “7am PT”).

## **Compliance and Integrity**

* Don’t publish or amplify projects violating ENS DAO standards, Ethereum guidelines, or local regulations.  
* Avoid naming contracts on Enscribe if they misrepresent source code, ownership, or security status.  
* Encourage use of Enscribe **with** verifications like Sourcify or EIP-7512 attestations.

## **Final Thoughts**

Enscribe is a platform built to make the onchain world more legible. This guide exists to help you write clearly, confidently, and in ways that support that mission.

If you’re unsure whether something fits, ask: “Would I trust this if I were new to Ethereum?”
