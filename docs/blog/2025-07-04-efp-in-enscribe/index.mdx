The Enscribe team is committed to finding value adding integrations for our users. We’re pleased to announce our latest significant integrations to the Enscribe app — support for the [Ethereum Follow Protocol (EFP)](https://efp.app/).

The Ethereum Follow Protocol (EFP) is a decentralized social graph protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain. 🤝

With its support in Enscribe, whenever you search for an account, for instance, [vitalik.eth](https://app.enscribe.xyz/explore/1/0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045), you’ll now see their follower and following counts directly in the Account Details view.

You’ll also see EFP badges where available, along with links to their connected profiles on Farcaster, Lens, and other social platforms.

This gives every ENS-powered profile in Enscribe a richer, more human feel, and helps builders and users quickly understand how an account fits into the social graph of Ethereum.

The information is still supported by data about the ENS names associated with the account, so you now get the best of the ENS app and EFP in one place using Enscribe!

## Why it matters

Ethereum’s social layer is growing fast. But most wallets and explorers still treat onchain identities as flat and contextless. Enscribe already helps solve that by showing verified contract data and ENS names, rather than raw hex addresses.

Now with EFP, we go a step further with support for accounts, connecting the ENS names you see with meaningful signals of reputation and relationships.

You can now:
- See at a glance if an account is widely followed or active in the EFP ecosystem
- Discover who’s connected to who, all within the Enscribe UI
- Build trust faster when evaluating Ethereum addresses or ENS names

It’s a lightweight but powerful addition to the way we browse onchain identities.

## What is EFP?

EFP is an open, composable protocol for following Ethereum accounts. You can follow an ENS name, and see who they follow back, all onchain. It’s designed to be interoperable with wallets, dapps, and any app that wants to make identity portable and human-readable.

We believe this fits naturally with Enscribe’s mission to bring better UX, context, and trust to contract interactions.

## What’s next

With the EFP integration, we are surfacing useful account information for our users. With Enscribe’s mission to make smart contracts safer for users, it was important to find complementary teams focussed on providing similar services for accounts. This is why the EFP integration is so powerful.

In the coming weeks, we’ll be announcing some great new features for smart contracts, which help make services safer for users.

Until then, try it out by searching any account at <AppUrl/>. ENS names just got more social.

Happy naming! 🚀
