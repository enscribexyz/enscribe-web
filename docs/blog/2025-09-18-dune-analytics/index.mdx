title: "Understanding ENS & Contract Naming Trends: Insights from Our Dune Dashboard"

The [Enscribe](https://www.enscribe.xyz) team believes in the importance of having metrics to track our progress against our mission — eliminating hex contract addresses for users and making Ethereum safer.  [Ethereum Name Service (ENS)](https://ens.domains/) is central to this vision, but despite ENS adoption growing steadily, the gap between deployed contracts and named contracts remains significant.

That’s why we built a [Dune Analytics dashboard](https://dune.com/enscribe/contract-naming) to understand where ENS naming adoption for contracts stands today.

## Unpacking the Dashboard

Our dashboard provides a number of key charts, these are outlined below.

- **Total Number of Named Contracts** shows a count of how many contracts have primary ENS names

- **Total Number of Contracts That Can Be Named (ERC-173/ERC-5133)** shows how many contracts deployed on Ethereum can be set a primary name. These include ERC-173 and ERC-5133 contracts

- **Monthly Contract Naming Activity** shows contract naming activity since the last 4 years

- **Contract Names Set in Past 12 Months** reveals how many contracts have been assigned a primary ENS name in the past 12 months

- **Most Recently Named Contracts** shows the latest 1000 contracts with their primary ENS names sorted by date

## Making Hex a Relic of the Past

By tracking these metrics, we directly measure the impact of our efforts at Enscribe. We want to see the number of named contracts on Ethereum increase, with a view to ultimately eliminating hex contract addresses for users.

Millions of contracts are still unnamed, and each one represents an opportunity to make Ethereum more user-friendly and safer.

Join us in shaping a more human-readable Ethereum. Head over to [Enscribe](https://www.enscribe.xyz) and start naming your contracts today, then check the impact of your activity in our Dune dashboard.

Happy naming! 🚀
