title: Announcing the Enscribe Contract Naming Audit Service

Since we launched Enscribe, we've collaborated with a number of teams on their contract naming.

Whilst we try to ensure the naming process is as simple as possible in our app. Which is supported by extensive [documentation](/docs) and our [guides](/guides), it can be non-trivial for teams to get the naming work done. Especially when they have an existing legacy of contracts to name, as well as changes to be made to their deployment habits.

As a result of this, we've decided to launch a new service — the [Enscribe Contract Naming Audit](/audit), which maps every smart contract in your protocol, designs a complete ENS naming architecture, and delivers a launch-ready rollout plan.

## Smart Contract Naming Can't be an Afterthought

As protocols grow, so does the complexity of the contract surface area: proxies, implementations, admin roles and ownership, cross-chain deployments, and internal tooling assumptions. Development teams should standardize naming, but the real-world gets in the way.

This results in:

- Users don’t know which contracts belong to your protocol
- Wallets and explorers can’t present meaningful context about it
- Admin and ownership is unclear
- Onboarding developers takes longer
- Security reviewers must manually reconstruct your architecture

With ENS now widely integrated across wallets, explorers, and infra providers, naming is no longer “nice to have”, it’s part of your protocol’s identity and trust.

## A Naming Audit For Your Contract Ecosystem

With our Contract Naming Audit service, we provide a structured service designed to help teams map, organize, and publicly name every contract in their protocol using ENS.

The audit includes:

### 1. Full Smart Contract & Wallet Inventory

We analyze your entire contracts to build a picture of:

- All deployed contracts across chains
- Ownership, admin and upgrade paths
- Proxy types (EIP-1967, Beacon, Minimal, custom)
- Role/access control patterns
- Any orphaned or legacy deployments

This provides a holistic view of your onchain infrastructure.

### 2. ENS Naming Architecture & Implementation Guidance

Working with your team, we design a naming structure that reflects your protocol’s architecture:

- Namespace definition (`protocol.eth`)
- Subname hierarchy (`vaults.protocol.eth`, `router.v4.protocol.eth`, etc.)
- Cross-chain naming strategy
- Reverse resolution setup
- Naming rollout planning
- Technical assistance including code reviews, calldata generation/review for multisigs, updates to deployment pipelines

This ensures the foundations are right and the naming can scale with your project.

### 3. Go-to-market & Messaging

Naming only makes an impact if users, auditors, and partners see it.

Your contract audit includes:

- Announcement blog post
- Social communications
- Recommended rollout timing
- Additional messaging if required for partners, auditors, and ecosystem integrations

This gives you something to really shout about with your project that is beneficial for your users and Ethereum as a whole.

## Why Teams Choose Enscribe

Enscribe powers ENS naming for protocols who want:

- **Clearer user experience** across wallets and explorers
- **Better auditability** through visible ownership and permissioning of onchain contracts
- **Reduced operational** risk by surfacing deployment patterns
- **A unified naming framework** across all deployments
- **A polished public launch** with consistent messaging

We’ve seen repeatedly that naming when done right, becomes part of the developer experience, the security story, and the brand.

## Naming Contracts = Responsible Development

We believe smart contract naming is a key trust layer for web3.

And we’re excited to bring a structured, repeatable audit process to help teams adopt it cleanly, safely, and with confidence.

Happy naming! 🚀
