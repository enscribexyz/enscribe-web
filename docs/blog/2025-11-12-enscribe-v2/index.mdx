# EnscribeV2 is now live on Ethereum mainnet

Enscribe V2 is now deployed on Ethereum mainnet. This upgrade brings batch operations, multi-chain support, and gas optimizations that make naming large numbers of contracts practical.

## Contract Addresses

**Ethereum Mainnet:**
- [Enscribe V2](https://etherscan.io/address/0x9B95a964DB0ab154A587cC667b4964BD5dD8dE81): `0x9B95a964DB0ab154A587cC667b4964BD5dD8dE81`
- [ENS Name](https://app.ens.domains/v2.app.enscribe.eth): `v2.app.enscribe.eth`

**Testnet (Sepolia):**
- [Enscribe V2](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0xeA80b94a8B339c592c4F08bcCC87De7b57384BDD): `0xeA80b94a8B339c592c4F08bcCC87De7b57384BDD`
- [ENS Name](https://sepolia.app.ens.domains/v2.enscribe.named.eth): `v2.enscribe.named.eth`

## The Problem: Naming Contracts at Scale

Projects deploying multiple smart contracts face a challenge: each contract needs a separate ENS transaction to get a human-readable name. For a project with 10, 20, or 100+ contracts, this means:

- Dozens of individual transactions
- High cumulative gas costs
- Hours of manual execution
- Complex workflow coordination

A DAO deploying governance contracts, treasury modules, and token contracts previously needed separate ENS transactions for each — monitoring every transaction and managing a complex deployment process.

Enscribe V2 solves this.

## What's New

### Batch Contract Naming

Name multiple existing contracts in a single transaction.

```solidity
// Name 10 contracts at once
address[] memory contracts = [
    0x1234..., // governance.dao.eth
    0x5678..., // treasury.dao.eth
    0x9abc..., // token.dao.eth
    0x0000.... // 0x0 address to reserve the subname
];

string[] memory labels = ["governance", "treasury", "token", "reserve"];

enscribeV2.setNameBatch(
    contracts,
    labels,
    "dao.eth",
    [60, 2147492101] // Ethereum and Base cointypes
);
```
Note: The `reserve` subname is created with the `address(0)` address. This is useful when you just want to create the subname but not set an address yet.

### ENSIP-19 Multi-Chain Support

Set forward resolution for multiple chains at once:
```solidity
uint256[] memory coinTypes = [
    60,    // Ethereum
    2147492101,   // Base
    42161, // Arbitrum
    10     // Optimism
];

enscribeV2.setName(
    contractAddress,
    "bridge",
    "protocol.eth",
    coinTypes
);
```

This matters for cross-chain protocols and multi-chain deployments where the same contract needs to resolve on different networks.

### Simpler API

**Before V2:**
```solidity
bytes32 parentNode = namehash("myproject.eth"); // Manual computation
enscribe.setName(addr, "app", "myproject.eth", parentNode);
```

**With V2:**
```solidity
enscribe.setName(addr, "app", "myproject.eth"); // Computed automatically
```

The contract now computes parent nodes using ENS's NameCoder library.

### Reserve Names Without Addresses

Create subnames without setting an address:
```solidity
address[] memory contracts = [
    0x1234...,    // Active contract
    address(0),   // Reserve "staging", 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 address
    0x5678...     // Active contract
];

enscribeV2.setNameBatch(
    contracts,
    ["prod", "staging", "analytics"],
    "myproject.eth"
);
```

As demontrated in [Batch Contract Naming section](#batch-contract-naming) also, using `address(0)` creates the subname but skips forward resolution — useful for just creating the subname.

Projects can now:
- Name dozens of contracts in one transaction
- Save gas through batch operations and  new gas optimizations
- Can name contracts on multiple chains at once
- Fully ENSIP-19 compatible

## Technical Improvements

V2 includes several optimizations:

- **ENS NameCoder Integration**: Uses official ENS library gas savings per operation
- **OpenZeppelin Create2**: Deterministic contract deployment with industry-standard implementation
- **Custom Errors and Events**: ~50% gas savings on reverts compared to string messages
- **Internal Optimizations**: Automatic subname existence checking and address validation

## What's Next

Enscribe V2 contracts are live and ready to use via web3 libraries or transaction builders like Gnosis Safe.

**Coming Soon:**
- UI updates for batch operations and multi-chain support on [Enscribe app](https://app.enscribe.xyz)
- EnscribeV2 integration to our Enscribe library
- EnscribeV2 for Basenames

## Building Contract Identity

Enscribe makes smart contracts easier to trust by giving them human-readable names. Earlier this year, we [proposed an ENSIP](/blog/ensip-proposal) for contract metadata standards. V2's batch capabilities and multi-chain support lay the groundwork for that vision — making it practical for projects to build complete, discoverable contract identities.

Whether you're deploying a DeFi protocol, launching a DAO, or building any multi-contract system, Enscribe V2 helps you establish clear contract identity from day one.
