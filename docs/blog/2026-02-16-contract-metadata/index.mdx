Smart contracts are the backbone of Web3, but discovering information about them has always been fragmented. Contract metadata lives across multiple platforms — documentation on one site, audits on another, social links scattered everywhere, and basic information like "what does this contract actually do?" often nowhere to be found.

We're changing that by bringing comprehensive contract metadata onchain through ENS text records.

## The New Contract Metadata Standard

As part of the [Contract Naming Season](/blog/contract-naming-season), we've been working on a draft [ENSIP proposal for contract metadata standards](https://github.com/ensdomains/ensips/pull/50). This proposal defines a standardized set of text records that projects can use to attach rich information to their smart contracts.

The goal is simple: when you look at a contract's ENS name, you should be able to see everything you need to know about it — who built it, what it does, where to find documentation, security audits, and more — all in one place.

## Contract Metadata Fields

The Contract details page has several categories of text records that contracts or its parent organization can set:

### Basic Information
- **name**: The display name for the contract (e.g., "Uniswap V3 Router")
- **description**: What the contract does
- **url**: Official website or landing page
- **avatar**: Contract logo or icon (IPFS hash, HTTP URL, or data URI)
- **header**: Banner or background image for the contract page

### Social & Community
- **com.github**: GitHub repository URL
- **com.twitter**: Twitter/X profile
- **org.telegram**: Telegram community link
- **com.linkedin**: LinkedIn company page
- Any other social text record you want to set

### Documentation & Audit Reports
- **docs**: Documentation URL
- **audits**: Security audit reports (can link to a page with multiple audits)
- **category**: Contract type or category (e.g., "DeFi", "NFT", "Governance")
- **license**: Software license information

## Organization-Level vs Contract-Level Metadata

One powerful feature of this system is **metadata inheritance**. You can set metadata at the organization level (the parent ENS name) and have it automatically apply to all contracts under that name.

For example, if you set an avatar and social links on `protocol.eth`, all contracts named under it (`router.protocol.eth`, `factory.protocol.eth`, etc.) will inherit those values — unless they set their own.

### How It Works

```
protocol.eth (organization)
├─ avatar: ipfs://QmXyz...
├─ com.github: github.com/protocol
├─ com.twitter: twitter.com/protocol
│
├─ router.protocol.eth
│  └─ inherits all metadata from protocol.eth
│
├─ factory.protocol.eth
   ├─ description: "Factory contract for creating pairs"
   └─ inherits avatar and social links from protocol.eth
```

This means you can establish your project's identity once at the top level, and all your contracts benefit from it. You only need to set contract-specific details (like descriptions or audit links) for individual contracts.

## The New Contract Explore Page

We've completely redesigned the contract explore page to showcase this metadata.

{/* ![New contract page layout](./new-layout.png) */}

### What's New

**Header & Avatar Section**
- Circular avatar prominently displayed
- Header image as a subtle background
- Contract name and description front and center
- Social links with branded icons right below, making it easy for users to find official channels.


**Clean Layout**
- Contract details like docs, audits, category, license, etc. organized in clear sections
- ENS management and organization information (owner, manager, parent of ENS name)
- Contract deployer and verification status
- ABI and source code when the contract is verified on Sourcify

All text records are now visible in a dedicated metadata section, making it easy to see what information a project has set.

## How Contract Metadata is Retrieved

Behind every contract page on Enscribe is a sophisticated metadata retrieval API that intelligently queries ENS records at multiple levels and integrates with external verification services.

### Multi-Level Querying with Fallback

When you view a contract on Enscribe, the system doesn't just look at that specific contract's ENS name. It builds a complete hierarchy and queries each level to find the most specific metadata available.

When the Contract Metadata API receives a request for `router.v3.uniswap.eth`, here's how it works:

```
1. router.v3.uniswap.eth (most specific)
   ↓ no metadata found
2. v3.uniswap.eth (parent level)
   ↓ avatar, name found
3. uniswap.eth (organization level)
   ↓ social links, header found
4. eth (TLD)
   ↓ stop
```

{/* ![Metadata inheritance flow](./inheritance-flow.png) */}

The system queries all levels in parallel for maximum speed, then prioritizes the most specific value found for each field. This means:

- A contract can inherit its organization's avatar and social links
- But override the description with contract-specific details
- While using the project-level header image

## The Contract Metadata API

To make it easy for anyone to access this metadata, we've built a public API endpoint:

```
https://app.enscribe.xyz/api/v1/contractMetadata/<chain-id>/<ens-name>
```

### Example Request

```bash
curl https://app.enscribe.xyz/api/v1/contractMetadata/1/v3-router.uniswap.eth
```

### Example Response

```json
{
  "name": "Uniswap V3 Router",
  "description": "The Uniswap V3 Router contract handles all swaps through the protocol",
  "url": "https://uniswap.org",
  "avatar": "ipfs://QmXyz...",
  "header": "ipfs://QmAbc...",
  "docs": "https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v3/reference/periphery/SwapRouter",
  "audits": "https://uniswap.org/audits",
  "category": "DeFi",
  "license": "GPL-3.0",
  "com.github": "https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-periphery",
  "com.twitter": "https://twitter.com/Uniswap",
  "org.telegram": "https://t.me/uniswap"
}
```

### Features

- **Multichain support**: Works across all chains Enscribe supports (Ethereum, Base, Optimism, Arbitrum, Scroll, Linea, and their testnets)
- **Fallback resolution**: Automatically checks parent domains for inherited metadata
- **Fast parallel fetching**: Optimized to fetch all records concurrently
- **Standard format**: Returns JSON with all available text records

### Use Cases

- **Wallets**: Display rich contract information in transaction confirmations
- **Block explorers**: Show official metadata alongside contract data
- **DApp frontends**: Pull verified information about contracts you interact with
- **Aggregators**: Build indices of contract metadata across the ecosystem
- **Documentation sites**: Auto-generate contract directories with official info

## Why This Matters

### For Projects

- **Single source of truth**: Set your contract information once, onchain
- **Discoverability**: Users can find everything about your contracts in one place
- **Trust signals**: Verified information through ENS name ownership
- **Flexible updates**: Change metadata as your project evolves
- **Inheritance**: Set organization identity once, apply to all contracts

### For Users

- **Transparency**: See who's behind a contract before interacting
- **Verification**: Check official links and documentation easily
- **Context**: Understand what a contract does at a glance
- **Security**: Find audit reports directly from contract metadata

### For the Ecosystem

- **Standardization**: Common format for contract metadata across all projects
- **Composability**: Any tool can read and display this information
- **Onchain**: No reliance on centralized databases or APIs
- **Extensible**: Projects can add custom fields as needed

We'd love to hear your thoughts on contract metadata:
- What fields would be most useful for your projects?

Contract metadata is about bringing order to the chaos of onchain information. With a standardized approach to contract identity, we can build better tools, clearer interfaces, and a more transparent Web3.

Happy naming! 🚀
