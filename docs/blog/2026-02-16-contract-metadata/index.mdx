Smart contracts are the backbone of Web3, but discovering information about them has always been fragmented. Contract metadata lives across multiple platforms — documentation on one site, audits on another, social links scattered everywhere, and basic information like "what does this contract actually do?" often nowhere to be found.

We're changing that by bringing comprehensive contract metadata onchain through ENS text records.

{/* ![Contract metadata display](./contract-page.png) */}

## The New Contract Metadata Standard

As part of the [Contract Naming Season](/blog/contract-naming-season), we've been working with the ENS community on a draft [ENSIP proposal for contract metadata standards](https://github.com/ensdomains/ensips/pull/50). This proposal defines a standardized set of text records that projects can use to attach rich information to their smart contracts.

The goal is simple: when you look at a contract's ENS name, you should be able to see everything you need to know about it — who built it, what it does, where to find documentation, security audits, and more — all in one place.

## Contract Metadata Fields

The draft ENSIP defines several categories of metadata that contracts can set:

### Basic Information
- **name**: The display name for the contract (e.g., "Uniswap V3 Router")
- **alias**: Alternative name or shorter version
- **description**: What the contract does
- **url**: Official website or landing page
- **avatar**: Contract logo or icon (IPFS hash, HTTP URL, or data URI)
- **header**: Banner or background image for the contract page

### Visual Identity
Projects can now set both an avatar (circular profile image) and a header image (banner background) for their contracts. The header displays behind contract details with subtle transparency, giving each contract a unique visual identity.

{/* ![Visual identity example](./visual-identity.png) */}

### Social & Community
- **com.github**: GitHub repository URL
- **com.twitter**: Twitter/X profile
- **org.telegram**: Telegram community link
- **com.linkedin**: LinkedIn company page

These social links appear directly on the contract page with branded icons, making it easy for users to find official channels.

### Documentation & Resources
- **docs**: Documentation URL
- **audits**: Security audit reports (can link to a page with multiple audits)
- **category**: Contract type or category (e.g., "DeFi", "NFT", "Governance")
- **license**: Software license information

### Technical Information
- **compiled-metadata**: Compiler metadata and source files (multichain support via cointype)

## Organization-Level vs Contract-Level Metadata

One powerful feature of this system is **metadata inheritance**. You can set metadata at the organization level (the parent ENS name) and have it automatically apply to all contracts under that name.

For example, if you set an avatar and social links on `protocol.eth`, all contracts named under it (`router.protocol.eth`, `factory.protocol.eth`, etc.) will inherit those values — unless they set their own.

### How It Works

```
protocol.eth (organization)
├─ avatar: ipfs://QmXyz...
├─ com.github: github.com/protocol
├─ com.twitter: twitter.com/protocol
│
├─ router.protocol.eth
│  └─ inherits all metadata from protocol.eth
│
├─ factory.protocol.eth
   ├─ description: "Factory contract for creating pairs"
   └─ inherits avatar and social links from protocol.eth
```

This means you can establish your project's identity once at the top level, and all your contracts benefit from it. You only need to set contract-specific details (like descriptions or audit links) for individual contracts.

## The New Contract Explore Page

We've completely redesigned the contract explore page to showcase this metadata.

{/* ![New contract page layout](./new-layout.png) */}

### What's New

**Header & Avatar Section**
- Circular avatar prominently displayed
- Header image as a subtle background
- Contract name and description front and center
- Social links with branded icons right below

**Clean Layout**
- Contract details organized in clear sections
- Management information (owner, manager, parent)
- Contract deployer and verification status
- ABI and source code with adaptive sizing

**Metadata Display**
All text records are now visible in a dedicated metadata section, making it easy to see what information a project has set.

{/* ![Metadata section](./metadata-section.png) */}

## How Contract Metadata is Retrieved

Behind every contract page on Enscribe is a sophisticated metadata retrieval system that intelligently queries ENS records at multiple levels and integrates with external verification services.

### Multi-Level Querying with Fallback

When you view a contract on Enscribe, the system doesn't just look at that specific contract's ENS name. It builds a complete hierarchy and queries each level to find the most specific metadata available.

Here's how it works for a contract named `router.v3.uniswap.eth`:

```
1. router.v3.uniswap.eth (most specific)
   ↓ no metadata found
2. v3.uniswap.eth (parent level)
   ↓ avatar, name found
3. uniswap.eth (organization level)
   ↓ social links, header found
4. eth (TLD)
   ↓ stop
```

{/* ![Metadata inheritance flow](./inheritance-flow.png) */}

The system queries all levels in parallel for maximum speed, then prioritizes the most specific value found for each field. This means:

- A contract can inherit its organization's avatar and social links
- But override the description with contract-specific details
- While using the project-level header image

### Intelligent Inheritance Strategy

Different metadata fields have different inheritance behaviors:

**Direct-Only Fields** (no inheritance):
- `alias` - Contract-specific alternative names

**Fallback Fields** (inherit from parent):
- `avatar` - Visual identity
- `name` - Display name
- `description` - What it does
- `header` - Banner image
- `url` - Official website
- Social links (`com.github`, `com.twitter`, `org.telegram`, `com.linkedin`)
- Resources (`docs`, `audits`, `category`, `license`)

This inheritance model means organizations can set their identity once at the top level, and all contracts automatically benefit from it unless they explicitly override specific fields.

### Behind the Scenes: The API Flow

When the Contract Metadata API receives a request for `router.v3.uniswap.eth`:

**Step 1: Build the Domain Chain**
```javascript
[
  'router.v3.uniswap.eth',  // most specific
  'v3.uniswap.eth',
  'uniswap.eth',            // organization root
  'eth'                     // TLD (usually no metadata)
]
```

**Step 2: Parallel Fetch**
The API simultaneously queries the ENS resolver for all metadata fields across all domain levels:

```javascript
// All queries execute in parallel
Promise.all([
  getText('router.v3.uniswap.eth', 'avatar'),
  getText('router.v3.uniswap.eth', 'name'),
  getText('router.v3.uniswap.eth', 'description'),
  getText('v3.uniswap.eth', 'avatar'),
  getText('v3.uniswap.eth', 'name'),
  // ... and so on for all fields and levels
])
```

**Step 3: Priority Resolution**
For each metadata field, use the value from the most specific domain where it exists:

```javascript
// If router.v3.uniswap.eth has a description, use it
// Otherwise check v3.uniswap.eth
// Otherwise check uniswap.eth
// Otherwise return undefined
```

This parallel approach is significantly faster than the sequential "check one level, then the next" pattern, typically reducing API response time from seconds to milliseconds.

### Integrating with Sourcify for Contract Code

In addition to ENS metadata, Enscribe integrates with the [Sourcify API](https://sourcify.dev) to fetch verified contract source code and ABIs.

**The Sourcify Query Flow:**

1. **Check Full Match**: Query Sourcify for a perfect verification match (exact bytecode + metadata)
2. **Fallback to Partial Match**: If no full match, check for partial matches (source code verified but metadata differs)
3. **Display Source Files**: Show all Solidity source files with syntax highlighting
4. **Extract ABI**: Parse the contract's application binary interface for function/event signatures
5. **Show Compiler Settings**: Display Solidity version, optimization settings, and EVM version

When a contract is verified on Sourcify, users get immediate access to:
- Complete source code for all contract files
- Compiled contract ABI
- Compiler metadata (version, settings)
- IPFS links to metadata files

{/* ![Sourcify integration showing contract sources and ABI](./sourcify-integration.png) */}

If a contract isn't on Sourcify, Enscribe falls back to Etherscan's API to fetch whatever verification data is available there.

### How Organizations Benefit

This multi-level system creates powerful network effects for organizations managing multiple contracts:

**Set Once, Apply Everywhere**

An organization like Uniswap can set metadata on `uniswap.eth`:
```json
{
  "avatar": "ipfs://QmUniswap...",
  "header": "ipfs://QmHeader...",
  "com.github": "https://github.com/Uniswap",
  "com.twitter": "https://twitter.com/Uniswap",
  "org.telegram": "https://t.me/uniswap"
}
```

Now every contract under the Uniswap namespace automatically displays:
- The Uniswap logo
- Official social links
- Branded header image

**Selective Overrides**

Individual contracts can override specific fields while keeping others:

```
uniswap.eth
├─ avatar: [Uniswap logo]
├─ com.github: [Uniswap GitHub]
│
├─ v3-router.uniswap.eth
│  ├─ description: "Routes swaps through V3 pools"
│  ├─ docs: "https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v3/router"
│  └─ inherits: avatar, social links, header
│
├─ v3-factory.uniswap.eth
   ├─ description: "Creates and manages V3 liquidity pools"
   ├─ docs: "https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v3/factory"
   └─ inherits: avatar, social links, header
```

**Benefits for Large Deployments**

Projects with dozens or hundreds of contracts across multiple chains can:

- **Maintain consistent branding** without updating every single contract
- **Update organization info once** (e.g., new Twitter handle) and see it reflect everywhere
- **Minimize transaction costs** by only setting contract-specific details
- **Scale efficiently** as each new contract deployment inherits existing metadata

**Example: A DeFi Protocol**

```
protocol.eth (org level)
├─ Sets: avatar, header, social links, main website
│
├─ mainnet.protocol.eth (deployment level)
│  ├─ Sets: description for mainnet deployment
│  └─ Inherits: all org metadata
│  │
│  ├─ vault.mainnet.protocol.eth
│  ├─ router.mainnet.protocol.eth
│  ├─ staking.mainnet.protocol.eth
│  └─ [All inherit org + deployment metadata]
│
├─ base.protocol.eth (deployment level)
   ├─ Sets: description for Base deployment
   └─ Inherits: all org metadata
   │
   ├─ vault.base.protocol.eth
   └─ router.base.protocol.eth
```

{/* ![Organization-level inheritance example](./org-inheritance.png) */}

One organization record, dozens of contracts automatically branded and linked.

## The Contract Metadata API

To make it easy for anyone to access this metadata, we've built a public API endpoint:

```
https://app.enscribe.xyz/api/v1/contractMetadata/<chain-id>/<ens-name>
```

### Example Request

```bash
curl https://app.enscribe.xyz/api/v1/contractMetadata/1/v3-router.uniswap.eth
```

### Example Response

```json
{
  "name": "Uniswap V3 Router",
  "description": "The Uniswap V3 Router contract handles all swaps through the protocol",
  "url": "https://uniswap.org",
  "avatar": "ipfs://QmXyz...",
  "header": "ipfs://QmAbc...",
  "docs": "https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v3/reference/periphery/SwapRouter",
  "audits": "https://uniswap.org/audits",
  "category": "DeFi",
  "license": "GPL-3.0",
  "com.github": "https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-periphery",
  "com.twitter": "https://twitter.com/Uniswap",
  "org.telegram": "https://t.me/uniswap"
}
```

### Features

- **Multichain support**: Works across all chains Enscribe supports (Ethereum, Base, Optimism, Arbitrum, Scroll, Linea, and their testnets)
- **Fallback resolution**: Automatically checks parent domains for inherited metadata
- **Fast parallel fetching**: Optimized to fetch all records concurrently
- **Standard format**: Returns JSON with all available text records

### Use Cases

- **Wallets**: Display rich contract information in transaction confirmations
- **Block explorers**: Show official metadata alongside contract data
- **DApp frontends**: Pull verified information about contracts you interact with
- **Aggregators**: Build indices of contract metadata across the ecosystem
- **Documentation sites**: Auto-generate contract directories with official info

## Why This Matters

### For Projects

- **Single source of truth**: Set your contract information once, onchain
- **Discoverability**: Users can find everything about your contracts in one place
- **Trust signals**: Verified information through ENS name ownership
- **Flexible updates**: Change metadata as your project evolves
- **Inheritance**: Set organization identity once, apply to all contracts

### For Users

- **Transparency**: See who's behind a contract before interacting
- **Verification**: Check official links and documentation easily
- **Context**: Understand what a contract does at a glance
- **Security**: Find audit reports directly from contract metadata

### For the Ecosystem

- **Standardization**: Common format for contract metadata across all projects
- **Composability**: Any tool can read and display this information
- **Onchain**: No reliance on centralized databases or APIs
- **Extensible**: Projects can add custom fields as needed

## Getting Started

### 1. Name Your Contracts

If you haven't already, [name your contracts with ENS](https://app.enscribe.xyz). You'll need ENS names to attach metadata.

### 2. Set Organization Metadata

Start by setting metadata on your parent ENS name:
- Avatar and header images
- Social links
- Main website URL
- GitHub organization

### 3. Add Contract-Specific Details

For each contract, add:
- Description of what it does
- Documentation links
- Audit reports
- Any contract-specific information

### 4. Keep It Updated

As your project evolves, update the metadata. Change is expected and the system is designed for it.

## What's Next

The draft ENSIP is currently under review by the ENS community. We're gathering feedback and refining the specification based on real-world usage.

We're also working on:
- **Metadata templates**: Pre-configured sets for common contract types
- **Verification badges**: Visual indicators for complete metadata
- **Search by metadata**: Find contracts by category, features, or other metadata
- **Historical tracking**: See how contract metadata changes over time

## API Documentation

Full API documentation is available at [docs.enscribe.xyz/api/contract-metadata](https://docs.enscribe.xyz/api/contract-metadata).
