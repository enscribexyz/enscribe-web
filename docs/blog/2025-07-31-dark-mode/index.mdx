At [Enscribe](https://app.enscribe.xyz), we're dedicated to improving the onchain experience for users. One part of this is by making smart contract addresses more human-readable and user-friendly by simplifying contract naming with ENS. 

While making the experience more user-friendly, we also want to improve the UI/UX of the Enscribe platform. In line with this commitment, we're excited to announce a key enhancement: **Enscribe now fully supports a dark mode theme!**

You can find the theme toggle button in the top right corner of the Enscribe application. The white sun icon indicates the light theme, and the dark moon icon activates the new dark theme.

Every screen within Enscribe now adapts to dark mode, designed with carefully chosen color contrasts for optimal readability. This ensures a consistent and comfortable visual experience across the entire application, whether you're deploying a new contract or reviewing your existing ones.

We've ensured that key workflows, from **deploying new contracts** and **naming existing ones** to viewing your **account details** and **managing your contracts**, are all optimized for the new dark theme. The improved contrast aims to make your interactions with Enscribe smoother and less straining on the eyes.
