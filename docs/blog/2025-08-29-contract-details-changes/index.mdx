With [Enscribe](https://www.enscribe.xyz), we’re always looking for ways to make viewing smart contracts details simpler and safer for users. Our latest update to the Contract Details page introduces two subtle yet impactful changes designed to improve clarity and usability for our users.

## Spot Your Primary Contracts at a Glance

When looking at contract information, it can be a little overwhelming when trying to identify what the primary name of the contract is. To simplify this, we’ve introduced a blue tick next to primary contract names.

Now, when you view the Contract Details page for a particular contract, you can easily see if a primary name is set for the contract.

We’ve also shown a tooltip that tells you you are looking at a primary name:

![tooltip1](tooltip1.png)

For contracts that have no primary name set but do have at least one forward resolution name set, we now also show that name:

However, to make sure that we differentiate between primary and forward resolution names, we show the usual cautionary warning sign as well as explain it in the tooltip:

## Introducing the “Name It!” Button

Contracts without names can make browsing blockchain data cumbersome. That’s why we’ve added the Name It! button next to contract addresses that:

    - Don’t yet have a primary name set,  or
    - Have at least one forward resolution name available.

Here’s a proxy contract that has no name set:

Here’s a contract that doesn’t have a primary name set but has a forward resolution name set:

Clicking the button takes you straight to the Name Contract page on Enscribe, with the contract address pre-filled. This saves you time, reduces manual input and ensures you can seamlessly add meaningful, human-readable names to your contracts.

By making it easier to name your contracts, we’re helping you keep your on-chain activity clear and structured.

## Why These Changes Matter

With these enhancements, we’re continuing our mission to make on-chain data more accessible and user-friendly. Whether you’re a developer, an ENS enthusiast, or just someone managing multiple contracts for a project, these updates simplify contract name identification and improve overall interaction experience on Enscribe
