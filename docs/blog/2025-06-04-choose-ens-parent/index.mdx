We've rolled out a great new feature in Enscribe — the ability to easily choose your **owned or managed ENS domains** when deploying or naming smart contracts. 
This makes it straightforward to find the right ENS parent name you want to name your contract with.

Thanks to the integration with **ENS Subgraph** , Enscribe can now fetch all ENS names that your connected wallet **owns or manages** and show them to you.

## How It Works
When a user connects their wallet, Enscribe queries the ENS subgraph and retrieves a complete list of ENS domains owned or managed by that wallet. These names are then:

- Grouped by second-level domain (2LD)  
- Sorted alphabetically  
- Displayed in a modal

## Demo

Check out the below video to see it in action:

Here’s how it looks in Enscribe:

**Deploy Contract Form with ENS selection:**

## Why It Matters

Before this update, users had to remember and manually type their ENS parent name — introducing user error. 

This feature is currently supported on:

- **Ethereum Mainnet & Sepolia** — via the official ENS subgraph  
- **Linea Mainnet & Linea Sepolia** — via ENS Linea subgraph  
- **Base Mainnet** — via [ENS Node](https://github.com/namehash/ensnode) by [namehash](https://namehashlabs.org/)

**Note**: Support for **Base Sepolia testnet** is pending because no ENS subgraph exists yet. We're actively working with Namehash to add support — see [GitHub issue #768](https://github.com/namehash/ensnode/issues/768).

## Try It Out

Visit [enscribe.xyz](https://www.enscribe.xyz) and try the new ENS parent selection workflow in both the **Deploy** and **Name Contract** flows. 
Let us know what you think — your feedback helps us shape a smoother, safer, and more trusted smart contract experience.

We'd love to hear your feedback on this feature — join our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/8QUMMdS5GY) or [Telegram](https://t.me/enscribers) communities and let’s eliminate hex smart contract addresses for users.

Happy naming! 🚀
