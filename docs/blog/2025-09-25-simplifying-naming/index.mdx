Historically the [Enscribe App](https://www.enscribe.xyz) only supported creating subnames for naming smart contracts. This has changed with our latest release!

We recognise that some people may want to name their contracts directly with a 2LD such as `mymultisig.eth` or use a subname they have already created such as `treasury.mytoken.eth`.

We’re excited to introduce a revamped naming UX, where we’ve not only simplified the naming experience further for users, but now provide a second option when naming your contract via the Use Existing Name button.

This required us to think over the current naming flow and so we redesigned our Name Contract page all the while still keeping everything simple.

## Creating a New Subname 

We now have a button called Create Subname that lets you create a new subname. We show the same UI elements as before but with a few changes. We’ve simplified selecting a parent domain by replacing the Parent Name drop-down with a text field instead.

We’ve added a Select Domain button that lets you select either one of your existing domains or the one provided by Enscribe –

You can also create a new domain using the ENS app by clicking on the Purchase New Domain button. Clicking on this button will show a dialog that will confirm if you want to go to the ENS app.

## Using an Existing Name 

When you click on the Use Existing Name button, we show a Contract Name text field alongside the Select Name button to select one of the several names you already own.

Clicking on this button will show a dialog showing your names that can be selected.

When you select one of these names, it will be chosen as the name you want to set to your contract.

You can also enter an existing name in the text field.

This way, you don’t have to mint a new subname (and save gas!) and simply pick whichever name you would love to set for your contract

## Simplifying Naming

With the ability to use an existing name, we’ve cut down the effort it takes to name a contract when you already own a primary ENS name.

Our goal is for every contract on Ethereum to be named. Adding an option to use an existing name simplifies the naming process, giving users the choice to either create a new subname or simply use an existing name

It’s one more step in our broader mission to retire hex addresses for good from the Ethereum UX.

Head to [Enscribe App](https://www.enscribe.xyz) and try to name your contract with an existing name.

Happy Naming! 🚀
