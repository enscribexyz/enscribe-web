We’re excited to announce a major refresh to the [Enscribe Documentation](https://www.enscribe.xyz/docs) — built to help developers and users better understand 
how ENS naming works for smart contracts and how Enscribe makes that process seamless.


Whether you’re deploying new contracts or assigning ENS names to existing ones, the updated docs walk you through every part of 
the experience with clear explanations, examples, and new video walkthroughs.

## What's New?

The updated Enscribe docs are now structured to cover both technical depth and usability, giving you exactly what you need depending on your goal.

The Enscribe docs are now divided into three major sections:

### Introduction

![Introduction](introduction.png)

Get oriented. Learn what Enscribe is, why it exists, and how it bridges the gap between ENS and smart contract UX.

- **What is Enscribe?** - A high-level overview of the problem we’re solving.
- **Overview of ENS** - Understand how the ENS protocol works: Registry, Resolvers, Reverse Resolution, and more.
- **Naming Smart Contracts** - Why naming smart contracts is hard, and how Enscribe makes it simple.
- **Supported Networks** - Live Enscribe contract addresses across L1 and L2 chains like Sepolia, Base, and Linea.
- **Using Safe Wallet with Enscribe** - How to use the multisig Safe wallet.

### Getting Started

![Getting Started](getting-started.png)

Everything you need to know to go from “I have a contract” to “My contract has a beautiful ENS name.”

- **Contract Deployment Service** - Learn how to deploy a contract with ENS naming in a single transaction.
- **Naming Existing Contracts** - Assign names and reverse resolution to contracts that already exist on-chain.
- **Deployment History** - Track previous deployments and view assigned names.
- **Bytecode and ABIs** - Understand how contract bytecode and constructor arguments are handled in Enscribe.
- **The Operator Role in ENS, Why and How?** - Get clarity on why operator permission is needed and how it’s securely managed by Enscribe.


This section is packed with video walkthroughs, UI screenshots, and interactive examples to help you get hands-on quickly.

### Advanced (Coming Soon)

For those looking to dive deeper into ENS internals, smart contract design, and Layer 2 nuances — the Advanced section will soon include:

- **ENS Terminology** - A glossary of ENS-specific concepts for developers and power users.
- **ENS on L1 vs L2 chains** - A detailed breakdown of how ENS behaves differently across Ethereum mainnet, Base, Linea, and other L2s.
- **Design and Architecture** - A full overview of the Enscribe contract system, including sequence diagrams, CREATE2 deployment flow, and ENS contract interactions.
