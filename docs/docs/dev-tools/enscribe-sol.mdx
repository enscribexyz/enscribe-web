# Foundry Library

> Foundry Solidity library that works with Foundry scripts to enable contract naming at deployment time.

## Installation

```bash
forge install enscribexyz/enscribe
```
---

## High-level API

```solidity
function setName(
    uint256 chainId,
    address contractAddress,
    string memory fullName
) internal returns (bool success)
```

Sets both forward and reverse resolution for a contract address. This is the main function you'll use in most cases.

#### Example

```solidity
import {Script, console} from "forge-std/Script.sol";
import {Counter} from "../src/Counter.sol";
import {Ens} from "enscribe/Ens.sol";

contract CounterScript is Script {
    function run() public {
        vm.startBroadcast();

        counter = new Counter();
        Ens.setName(block.chainid, address(counter), "mycontract.mydomain.eth");

        vm.stopBroadcast();
    }
}
```
---

```solidity
function setName(
    uint256 chainId,
    address contractAddress,
    string memory fullName
) internal returns (bool success)
```

Sets only forward resolution (name → address) without setting reverse resolution. Useful when you only need forward lookup.

#### Example

```solidity
import {Script, console} from "forge-std/Script.sol";
import {Counter} from "../src/Counter.sol";
import {Ens} from "enscribe/Ens.sol";

contract CounterScript is Script {
    function run() public {
        vm.startBroadcast();

        counter = new Counter();
        Ens.setForwardResolution(block.chainid, address(counter), "mycontract.mydomain.eth");

        vm.stopBroadcast();
    }
}
```
